Website to support the junior doctors strike in the UK.

Initially JuniorDoctorsStrike was meant to collect messages from various social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, but later has only been implemented for Twitter.

Facebook retired the Graph API and Instagram locked down the search API to only a few selected services.

However, JuniorDoctorsStrike still went public by collecting Twitter messages with various hashtags and aggregating them into one centralised feed which was open to the public.
