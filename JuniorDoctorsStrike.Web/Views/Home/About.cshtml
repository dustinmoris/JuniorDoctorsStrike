    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Welcome to http://JuniorDoctorsStrike.co.uk. My name is Dustin and I am the creator of this website. I am not a junior doctor, I don't work for the NHS and I am not politically relatd to this debate whatsoever. I am just a plain software developer who cares about the NHS and has a huge respect for all the people who are involved to make it happen.</p>

    <p>Public healthcare is a precious gift and it is not an environment like anything else. It is an institution which is run by people for people. It is not lucrative, it is very demanding, stressful, emotional and exhausting. Nowadays it is not even very grateful anymore. There is no reason to work in public healthcare other than the joy of helping other people. Those people who work for the NHS often sacrifice their own families and their own health when working relentlessly for extremely long shifts and they never complain or ask for anything back.</p>

    <p>I could never do this job myself and to be honest I wouldn't want to do it even if I could. However, I am grateful that not everyone thinks like me and therefore I decided that I want to use my skills to help the people who help us. This and many other reasons motivated me to create http://juniordoctorsstrike.co.uk.</p>
